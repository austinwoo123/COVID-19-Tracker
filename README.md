## Description
In todayâ€™s society, many people are woefully uninformed regarding COVID-19. We want to help people be more aware of COVID-19, showcase current statistics of Covid in a given area, and provide important information to the public. We hope to provide the necessary resources to enlighten users of the real threat of COVID-19.
